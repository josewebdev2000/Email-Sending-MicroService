## Overview

<div>
    <p>Microservices are small simple independent API's that have one main task.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this project is to programatically send emails when a request comes in.</p>
    <p>This microservice can either send plain text or a HTML template.</p>
   <p>An <b>API Key</b> is required to send emails. It will <b>NOT</b> be shared since it is for my personal use only.
   </p>
   <p>This project was built using the <b>ASP.NET Core Web API</b> template.</p>
   <p>This project is deployed thanks to <b>Docker</b> containers.</p>
